# Testdiffman

An API integration testing tool that compares a response against the API blueprint. The goal is to allow users to quickly see where their APIs are not matching the expected response.
 
The output will indicate where there are differences, and indicate if it's breaking the API contract, contains new information, or is missing optional fields.
